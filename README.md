If you wish to view this project, any code editor should be fine (no need proper IDE also can).
I personnely uses VSCode with simple C# plugin to code this project.
I didn't liked the C# naming convention, but didn't had one myself, so you can see my naming convension is kinda messy xD.

Dotnet 5.0 SDK is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac  

Build or Run is being peformed using the dotnet CLI tool.  
Use `dotnet run` command in the root directory to run the code (where the OomAssignment.csproj file is located)  
Use `dotnet build` to build an executable binary for your operating system (where the OomAssignment.csproj file is located)  
The output of the built file will be located under the /bin/Debug/net5.0 directory
